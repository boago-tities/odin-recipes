# odin-recipes
This project that i have been working is about Recipes, i am to create 3 webpages about recipes and i have to use links to link all of the 3 recipe pages to the home page(index) and i had to create lists, headings  and had to insert pictures.


At first i did not understand what i was doing but this entire journey made me understand firsthand how websites work!. I now understand clearly how the entire system of a website work, how you can switch to other pages in the page itself using relative links, adding images, links and using lists and i am now confident with my skills.
